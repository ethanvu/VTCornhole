			    <h3>Instructions</h3>
				<ol>
					<li id="step_1"><b>Assemble materials</b> – Before you begin building your Mini-Corn hole Board, 
					get all your materials(link to material page) together in one organized, 
					accessible area.  Also make sure the area you choose to construct in has plenty
					of space to work in</li>
					<li id="step_2"><b>Separate materials</b> – The package contains materials to make two separate boards. 
					All parts labeled with “A” as the first digit, are part of the first board, while all 
					parts labeled with “B” as the first digit belong to the second. Go through your parts 
					and put them with the corresponding group as shown in Figure 1.

						<figcaption>Figure 1 - Organize your pieces of the boards as pictured above to insure
						the assembly goes smoothly</figcaption>
					</figure>
					</li>
					<li id="step_3"><b>Start with A</b> – Begin by assembling the “A” board. Start by putting the “B” materials to the
					side and out of your way. Next separate A2-7 from A1 by putting them off to the side as shown in
					figure 2. This will give you a rough outline of where the pieces go.
					<figure>
						<img src="instruct_pics/figure2.jpg" alt="missing"/>
						<figcaption>Figure 2 - Separate the A1 piece from the rest of the pieces before you begin</figcaption>
					</figure>
					</li>
					<li id="step_4"><b>Screw in Long Sides</b> – Before you begin make sure that the letter and number are not visible 
					from the top before you start screwing pieces together. Take piece A2 and place it under the 
					left side of A1. Afterwards, take piece A3 and place it under the right side of A1, with the added 
					support from the other piece, line up the three holes between A3 and A1, then place silver screws 
					inside the holes and secure them with the screwdriver (Screw clockwise to tighten). Next, after A3 
					is secured to A1, do the same between A2 and A1 on the left side.
					<figure>
						<img src="instruct_pics/figure3.jpg" alt="missing"/>
						<figcaption>Figure 3 - Insure the holes are lined up properly so the fit is as tight as it can be.</figcaption>
					</figure>
					</li>
					<li id="step_5"><p><b>Screw in Top and Bottom</b> – Take piece A4 and place it under the top of A1. Next line up the 
					two holes so that the silver screws will go through cleanly. If you have trouble inserting the screw 
					try flipping the piece around to where it may fit better. Secure them with the screwdriver. After A4 
					is complete on top, grab A5 and repeat the process for the bottom this time</p>
					<figure>
						<img src="instruct_pics/figure4.jpg" alt="missing"/>
						<figcaption>Figure 4 - Screw the top piece in, then proceed with the bottom</figcaption>
					</figure>
					<p>5a. If you have trouble fitting either A4 or A5 in its correct spot you can use the sandpaper to sand 
					it down and get it to fit.</p>
					<figure>
						<img src="instruct_pics/figure5.jpg" alt="missing"/>
						<figcaption>Figure 5 - Sand the sides down for extra room if needed</figcaption>
					</figure>
					</li>
					<li id="step_6"><b>Secure Top and Bottom to Sides</b> - If you lined up A4 properly with A1 then you will notice that A4 
					has holes that line up with both A2 and A3, so tighten a black screw into each one to further secure 
					the board as shown in figure 6. After you have applied the screws connecting A4 to A2 and A3 then do 
					the same to A5 on the bottom.
					<figure>
						<img src="instruct_pics/figure6.jpg" alt="missing"/>
						<figcaption>Figure 6 - Place screws in the topmost and bottommost holes of the sides of the board</figcaption>
					</figure>
					</li>
					<li id="step_7"><b>Attach Legs</b> – Now, attach the legs, corresponding to the parts A6 and A7, to the underside of 
					the board. Start by flipping the board over and match up A7’s hole to the hole in the left side as shown 
					in figure 7. Hold it secure, slide a bolt in and secure it with a nut. Afterwards do the same for A6 on 
					the right side of the underbelly of the board. 
					<figure>

						<figcaption>Figure 7 - Hold the leg steady as you secure the bolt</figcaption>
					</figure>
					</li>
					<li id="step_8"><b>Stand the Board</b> – After the legs have been secured, flip the board over to stand it up. If the board 
					has a wobble and doesn’t stand up straight, then sand down the bottom of the legs until they are even and 
					the wobble is gone.
					<figure>
						<img src="instruct_pics/figure8.jpg" alt="missing"/>
						<figcaption>Figure 8 - Sand down the legs to even out the board</figcaption>
					</figure>
					</li>
					<li id="step_9"><b>Smooth out the Board’s Surface</b> – Now work your hand all around the surface of the board to feel for 
					rough spots. If you find any, use the sand paper to smooth them out. Some places to look for rough areas 
					would be places where cuts were made as well as areas where people are likely to carry the board.
					<figure>
						<img src="instruct_pics/figure9.jpg" alt="missing"/>
						<figcaption>Figure 9 - Look for rough spots and smooth them out</figcaption>
					</figure>
					</li>
					<li id="step_10">(<b>Optional) Coat board with 2 layers of Protective Finish</b> – The board is assembled and smoothed out. 
					So if you like, you can apply some coats of finish to it, in order to protect the wood and make it look 
					nicer. Of course you can also paint the board to really personalize it and make it your own, perhaps you 
					could make it the colors of your favorite sports team for game day, or make it red, white and blue for 
					July 4th, it’s really up to you!
					<figure>
						<img src="instruct_pics/figure10.jpg" alt="missing"/>
					</figure>
					</li>
					<li id="step_11"><b>Repeat for Board B</b> – Now that you have assembled the first board it should be much easier to go back 
					and repeat steps 3-10 with the corresponding B materials to create the second board.
					<figure>
						<img src="instruct_pics/figure11.jpg" alt="missing"/>
					</figure>
					</li>
					<li id="step_12"><b>Have Fun Playing!</b> – Find a Flat surface and spread the boards out. Each team takes turns throwing 
					bags at the other team’s board, any bag that hits the board and stays there is worth 1 point and any bag 
					that goes through the hole is worth 3. Keep taking turns until you run out of bags, whoever has the most 
					points, wins!
