				pursuing a career in software development at Cisco Systems.  He currently holds an associate’s 
				degree in Computer Science from Northern Virginia Community College.  Through his education, 
				Mark has acquired many programming skills and is proficient at writing code in Java.  He is not 
				limited to coding in Java, however, as Mark has experience with C++ and Python as well, rounding 
				out his knowledge of the high-level languages.  Mark has also come to practice at the lower level 
				as well, using the MARIE assembly language, giving him a great starting off point in working 
				closer to the machine.</p>
				<p>Mark Episcopo has completed numerous difficult projects throughout his 
				education.  One of which was creating functionality in Java for matrix functions such as row 
				reduction and determinant. He has also created the intelligence for a robot to perform various, 
				simulated functions in both MARIE and Java.  When Mark is not busy learning or honing his skills 
				he spends time with friends, watches the best TV HBO has to offer, and plays video games.</p>
